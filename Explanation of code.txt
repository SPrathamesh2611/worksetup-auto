# worksetup-auto
Explanation of the code:

Import necessary modules:

The webbrowser module is imported and assigned an alias wb. This module allows the script to open webpages in a web browser.
The os module is imported to launch the code editor.

Define the workauto function:
This function does not take any parameters.
The codepath variable is set to the path of the code editor executable (Microsoft Visual Studio Code in this case).
The os.startfile(codepath) command launches the code editor using the default program associated with the file type.

Open work-related webpages:
The Chrome_path variable is set to the path of the Google Chrome executable.
The URLS tuple contains the URLs of the work-related webpages to be opened.
A loop is used to iterate through each URL in the URLS tuple.
The wb.get(Chrome_path).open(url) command opens each URL in Google Chrome using the webbrowser module.

The combination of launching a code editor and opening specific webpages provides an automated approach to set up the work environment efficiently. 
Users can modify the code by updating the codepath variable and URLs in the URLS tuple to match their preferred applications and webpages.
