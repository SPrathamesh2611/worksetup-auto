Project Title: Work Setup Automation

Project Description:
The "Work Setup Automation" project is a Python script that automates the process of setting up a work environment by opening specific webpages and applications. 
It aims to enhance productivity and efficiency by eliminating the need for manual navigation and launching of essential tools.

The script utilizes the webbrowser and os modules in Python to open webpages in a web browser and launch applications, respectively.
By combining these functionalities, the project provides a streamlined approach to initiating a work session.

The main features of the project include:

Opening a code editor: The script launches a code editor, in this case, Microsoft Visual Studio Code, using the os.startfile function.
       This allows for quick access to the preferred code editor, enabling users to start coding without additional manual steps.

Opening work-related webpages: The script uses the webbrowser module to open a set of predefined webpages in Google Chrome. 
       These webpages can include email accounts, productivity tools, project management platforms, or any other web-based resources relevant to the work environment. 
       The URLs are defined in the URLS tuple, and the wb.get(Chrome_path).open(url) command opens each URL in Google Chrome.

The script provides a convenient way to set up the work environment by automating the launch of essential tools and webpages. 
Users can customize the URLs and add or remove applications based on their specific work requirements.
